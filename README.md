<h1>Dunn's Comics</h1>

My project is an online comic book shop where a user can view comics, graphic novels and manga that are for sale. The user can see the lists of comics, grahpic novels 
and manga that are for sale from the nav bar at the top of every page. There is also a recommendations section down near the bottom of the home page 
where the user can view popular comics, graphic novels and manga.

The comic, graphic novel and manga pages display a front cover of an issue, the issues name and the issues number and how much it can be purchased for. 

<h1>UX</h1>

The website is aimed at comic book, graphic novel and manga fans. A user of this website would be looking to purchase these items, the best way of achieving
this would be browsing through the collections that are on offer. With lots of images for the user to look at they can see what each cover looks like before
purchasing.

* As a new reader of comics, graphic novels and manga, I would like to know what is recommended to read.
* As a potenial customer I wish to know what comics, graphic novels and manga are available to purchase.
* As a potenial customer I wish to contact the online shop to see if they can order me something specific.

Balsamiq Wireframes have been added in a separate directory in pdf format. Some changes were made from orignal ideas.
