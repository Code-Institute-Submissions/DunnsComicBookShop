<h1>Dunn's Comics</h1>

My project is an online comic book shop where a user can view comics, graphic novels and manga that are for sale. The user can see the lists of comics, graphic novels 
and manga that are for sale from the nav bar at the top of every page. There is also a recommendations section down near the bottom of the home page 
where the user can view popular comics, graphic novels and manga.

The comic, graphic novel and manga pages display a front cover of an issue, the issues name and the issues number and how much it can be purchased for. 

<h1>UX</h1>

The website is aimed at comic book, graphic novel and manga fans. A user of this website would be looking to purchase these items, the best way of achieving
this would be browsing through the collections that are on offer. With lots of images for the user to look at they can see what each cover looks like before
purchasing.

* As a new reader of comics, graphic novels and manga, I would like to know what is recommended to read.
* As a potential customer I wish to know what comics, graphic novels and manga are available to purchase.
* As a potential customer I wish to contact the online shop to see if they can order me something specific.

Balsamiq Wireframes have been added in a separate directory in pdf format. Some changes were made from original ideas.

<h1>Features</h1>

* Home Page - the first place visited on the website, lets the user know what the website is about.

<h2>Existing Features</h2>

* Responsive nav bar - the nav bar is used on all pages, it will collapse down into a hamburger icon on smaller screen sizes. It has
 a drop down menu for the sections available on the page, when selected it will take you the section you have clicked. ie clicking DC will
 take you to DC section of comics. Was taken from bootstrap.
* Responsive main image - big main image of a popular comic. The is image is responsive and scales to the different screen sizes. Was helped by w3schools

<h2>Features Left to Implement</h2>

* An order basket, so the user can see what they wish to purchase.
* More selection of comics, graphic novels and manga, give the user a wider range of products to order.

<h1>Technologies Used</h1>

* [HTML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML) and [CSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) -  
main programming language used to create the website.
* [Javascript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) -  a little bit of JavaScript was used with the slidehsow to help it work.
* [jQuery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JQuery) - used for some of bootstraps styling.
* [Bootstrap4](https://getbootstrap.com/) - used for a lot of the layout of pages, nav bar and grid layout was taken from there.
* [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp) - was used for the main responsive image and also for slide show gallery.
* [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) - used to create the Wireframes, the desktop version was used.
* [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) - used for the headings and paragraph text, took Exo and Oswald also added the font weights.
* [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - used for the social links in the footer.
* [GitHub](https://github.com/) - used to host the website repository. 
* [GitPages](https://pages.github.com/) - used host the live website.
* [ResizeImage](https://resizeimage.net/) - used to resize the front covers of the books.

<h1>Testing</h1>

* Chrome Developer Tool - Lots of testing was carried out using the this tool. Was heavily used to check ths responsiveness of the website.
also used to test styling out first, ie paddings and margins.
* [HTMLValidator](https://validator.w3.org/) used to check the HTML code throughtout the creatation of the website.
* [CSSValidator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) used to check the CSS code throughtout the creatation of the website.

As part of testing the website chrome developer tool was used to text the responsiveness of the images, nav bar and footer across the different
screen sizes. It as been tested on;
 
 * Iphone 6/7/8 and the plus versions
 * Iphone X
 * Ipad and Ipad Pro
 * Mobile S-320px, M-375px, L-425px
 * Tablet-768px
 * Laptop-1024px
 * Laptop L-1440px
 * 4K-2560px

The nav bar links were tested to make sure the user was taken to the correct section when clicked, ie when a user clicked the DC link
under the comics drop down very were taken to top of the DC section on the comic book page.

The social links in the footer were tested to make sure the links took the user to correct social media website, it is only the home pages of
the websites as the social pages don't exist.

The comic, graphic novel and manga page all used the same responsive grid layout, number of columns change at different screen sizes and images
change size to fit the appropriate screen size, this was tested using the chrome developer took.

The slideshow gallery, was tested for image responsiveness using the chrome developer tool at different screen sizes, the images 
respond at the different media break points. The next and back features of the slideshow gallery were tested by clicking next and back cursors
to make sure they displayed the images in the correct order. The hover over the thumbnails images was tested by hovering over the images
and masking sure the correct opacity was displayed so the image could still be visible.
